    <h1>Natural Disaster Risk Viewer</h1>

    <p>
        The natural disaster risk viewer is a semantic web application that gives an overview of the world with 
        circles in different colors and sizes on the areas where natural disasters
        have occured. The areas hit by a natural disaster have been categorized into 4 categories of risk, the factors determining the category are
        the impact of the natural disasters that have hit the area and the income level of the country that the area is located in. Different categories
        of risk have different colors of circles on the map, the size of the circle is only dependent on the area size.
    </p>
    <p>
        Three data sources were used to create the natural disaster risk viewer. The freebase disaster dataset was used as the main source
        of data, containing data about natural disasters. Secondly the World Bank dataset was used to get data about the country income levels.
        Lastly DBpedia was used to gather more data about the areas that were hit by the natural disasters from the freebase dataset, like geolocation data,
        area size and the country of the area.
    </p>
    <p>
        The map allows you to freely look around, zoom in and out, and search on the location you're interested in. You can also click on the circles
        to go to the overview page of the corresponsing area which contains more information about the area and its relations with other entities.
